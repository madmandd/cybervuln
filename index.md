# BIO

A tangible ghost who loves to explore, self-study and research psychology, human behavior and cyber technology. I seem to only exist to observe, listen, and empathize with all surrounding phenomena.

Wanting to contribute quietly and conquer people's fears as well as achieve professional education.
